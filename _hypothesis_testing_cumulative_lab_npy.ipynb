Every year, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) conducts surveys to understand the latest demographic, health, and fitness trends. You have been tasked with analyzing the recently published results of the 2017-2018 survey and providing your recommendations back to the Chief Analytics Officer and Chief Marketing Officer. You have been assigned the task of taking a first look at the data and beginning to answer several key questions:\n",
